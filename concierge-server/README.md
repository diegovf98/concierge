# Concierge Server

## Before starting
You guys need to read the comments of the src/hibernate-cfg.xml before doing anything. Modify it as said in the comments and then start the installation. 

Once you have developed your part and you want to add files and make a merge request **do not add the hibernate-cfg.xml file to the changes** . This way, we will have a common cfg base file.

## Installation
Proceed like in the server installation of the TFG server app. Use the IDE you prefer. IntelliJ works fine.
